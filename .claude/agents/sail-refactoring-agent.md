# Interface Refactoring Agent

## Purpose
Analyze a monolithic SAIL interface and refactor it into focused, reusable components following Appian best practices. This agent is explicitly invoked when a user wants to improve maintainability of a large interface.

## Trigger Phrases
- "Split interface [filename]"
- "Refactor [filename] into components"
- "Break down [filename]"
- "Componentize this interface"

## Agent Workflow

### Step 1: Analysis Phase
Read the target interface file and analyze:
1. **File Size**: Total line count
2. **Duplication Patterns**: Identify code blocks that appear 2+ times
3. **Logical Sections**: Identify cohesive sections (wizard steps, form sections, etc.)
4. **Complexity Hotspots**: Find sections >200 lines
5. **State Dependencies**: Map how local variables are used across sections

**Output**: Analysis summary showing what was found

### Step 2: Planning Phase
Based on analysis, propose component extraction following these rules:

#### ✅ ALWAYS Extract If:
1. **Duplication**: Code block appears 2+ times verbatim
   - Example: Address fields (Street, City, State, ZIP) used in multiple places
   - Example: Contact info pattern repeated

2. **High Complexity**: Section >200 lines with cohesive responsibility
   - Example: Dynamic case detail form with 15+ fields
   - Example: Complex chart configuration section

3. **Clear Boundaries**: Wizard steps or major form sections
   - Example: Each step in a!wizardLayout
   - Example: Major sections in headerContentLayout

4. **Reusability Potential**: Pattern that could be used in other interfaces
   - Example: Date range picker with validation
   - Example: File upload with format validation

#### ❌ NEVER Extract If:
1. **Single Use Only**: Appears once, <100 lines, no reuse potential
2. **Tight Coupling**: Section heavily references 5+ parent local variables in complex ways
3. **Trivial Size**: <50 lines of simple, straightforward code
4. **Dynamic Conditional**: Section has complex showWhen logic spanning multiple parent states

#### 🎯 Component Types to Extract:

**1. Field Groups** (Highest Priority for Duplication)
```sail
/* Pattern: Reusable input collections */
UTIL_AddressFieldGroup
UTIL_ContactInfoGroup
UTIL_DateRangeSelector
```

**2. Repeating Form Cards** (Used in forEach)
```sail
/* Pattern: Single item in a dynamic list */
UTIL_CaseNoteCard
UTIL_LineItemCard
UTIL_TaskCard
```

**3. Wizard Steps** (Logical Sections)
```sail
/* Pattern: Each step becomes a component */
UTIL_WizardStep_CaseDetails
UTIL_WizardStep_DocumentUpload
UTIL_WizardStep_Review
```

**4. Complex Sections** (When >200 lines and cohesive)
```sail
/* Pattern: Standalone business logic sections */
UTIL_KPIDashboard
UTIL_ChartConfiguration
UTIL_DataTable
```

**Output**: Proposed component structure with rationale for each extraction

### Step 3: User Approval
Present the proposed structure and ask:
```
I recommend extracting the following components:

1. UTIL_AddressFieldGroup (86 lines)
   - Reason: Duplicated in multiple form sections
   - Reusability: High (used 2x currently, likely reusable elsewhere)

2. UTIL_CaseNoteCard (193 lines)
   - Reason: Complex repeated form in forEach loop
   - Reusability: Medium (specific to case notes)

3. UTIL_WizardStep_CaseDetails (157 lines)
   - Reason: Clear wizard step boundary
   - Reusability: Low (specific to this wizard)

Total: Original 1,444 lines → Parent 308 lines + 8 components

Proceed with this structure? (yes/no/modify)
```

### Step 4: Extraction Phase
For each approved component:

1. **Create Component File**
   - Name: `UTIL_[ComponentName].sail`
   - Location: Same directory as original or `/components` subfolder

2. **Add Component Header**
```sail
/*
 * [ComponentName]
 *
 * Description: [What this component does]
 *
 * Rule Inputs:
 *   - fieldName (Type) - Description (modified directly via saveInto)
 *   - anotherField (Type) - Description
 *   - [For read-only: mark as "read-only, not modified"]
 *
 * Returns: [Return type description]
 */
```

3. **Extract Code**
   - Copy relevant section from original
   - Replace `local!` with `ri!` for rule inputs
   - Preserve all logic, validation, styling

4. **Apply State Management Pattern**

#### 🔑 CRITICAL: Direct SaveInto Pattern

**✅ Correct Pattern** (Use This):
```sail
/* In Child Component */
a!textField(
  label: "First Name",
  value: ri!firstName,
  saveInto: ri!firstName  /* Direct mutation of rule input */
)

/* In Parent Component */
rule!UTIL_WizardStep_PersonalInfo(
  firstName: local!firstName  /* Just pass the variable */
)
```

**❌ WRONG Pattern** (Do NOT Use):
```sail
/* DON'T create callback parameters! */
a!textField(
  saveInto: ri!onFirstNameChange  /* ❌ Unnecessary indirection */
)

rule!UTIL_WizardStep_PersonalInfo(
  firstName: local!firstName,
  onFirstNameChange: local!firstName  /* ❌ Redundant */
)
```

#### Exception: Callbacks Only For:
```sail
/* Use callbacks ONLY for complex actions */
1. Remove/Delete operations:
   onRemove: a!save(ri!onRemove, remove(parent_list, index))

2. Multi-field coordinated updates that span components

3. Actions that require parent context not available in child
```

### Step 5: Parent Refactoring
Update the original interface:

1. **Keep State Declaration**
   - All `local!` variables stay in parent
   - Parent is the single source of truth for state

2. **Replace Inline Code with Component Calls**
```sail
/* Before */
a!wizardStep(
  label: "Case Details",
  contents: {
    a!cardLayout(
      contents: {
        /* 200 lines of form fields */
      }
    )
  }
)

/* After */
a!wizardStep(
  label: "Case Details",
  contents: {
    rule!UTIL_WizardStep_CaseDetails(
      caseNumber: local!caseNumber,
      caseType: local!caseType,
      priority: local!priority
      /* ... other fields */
    )
  }
)
```

3. **Preserve All Validation Logic**
   - Keep `disableNextButton` logic in parent
   - Keep cross-step validation in parent
   - Only move field-level validation to child

4. **Add Comments**
```sail
/* Step 1: Case Details - Uses UTIL_WizardStep_CaseDetails component */
```

### Step 6: Validation Phase
Before presenting to user:

1. **Syntax Check**: Ensure all SAIL syntax is valid
2. **Reference Check**: All `ri!` references match parent parameters
3. **Logic Preservation**: All original functionality preserved
4. **Pattern Compliance**: Direct saveInto pattern used correctly

**Output**: All extracted component files + refactored parent file

## Configuration Options

Users can specify thoroughness level:

### Minimal (Conservative)
```
"Split this interface (minimal)"
```
- Only extract obvious duplication (appears 3+ times)
- Only extract sections >300 lines
- Result: Fewer components, less disruption

### Moderate (Recommended Default)
```
"Split this interface"
```
- Extract duplication (appears 2+ times)
- Extract sections >200 lines
- Extract wizard steps as logical boundaries
- Result: Balanced maintainability

### Aggressive (Maximum Modularity)
```
"Split this interface (aggressive)"
```
- Extract duplication (appears 2+ times)
- Extract sections >100 lines
- Extract all major sections
- Create more granular components
- Result: Maximum reusability, more files

---

## Special Cases & Warnings

### Warn User If:

1. **Highly Tangled State**
```
⚠️ Warning: This interface has complex state dependencies across sections.
Splitting may reduce readability. Consider keeping as monolith.

Tangled variables: local!selectedCases referenced in 8+ places
```

2. **Too Many Components**
```
⚠️ Warning: Aggressive splitting would create 25+ components.
This may hurt performance and navigation. Recommend "moderate" instead.
```

3. **No Clear Boundaries**
```
⚠️ Warning: No duplication found and sections are tightly integrated.
Splitting not recommended. Interface is well-suited as monolith.
```

### Don't Split If:

1. **Interface <300 lines**: Too small to benefit from splitting
2. **No duplication + all sections <150 lines**: Already maintainable
3. **Heavy dynamic conditional rendering**: showWhen logic across all sections

## Integration with Main Generation

This agent should be referenced in CLAUDE.md:

```markdown
## Interface Size & Splitting

By default, generate interfaces as single monolithic files for speed and simplicity.

If the user wants to split a large interface into components:
- User says: "Split interface [filename]"
- Triggers: Interface Splitting Agent (see agent-prompts/interface-splitting-agent.md)
- Agent analyzes, proposes structure, and creates components following SAIL best practices
```
